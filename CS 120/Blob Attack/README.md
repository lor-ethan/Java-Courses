# Blob-Attack
CS 120

This program creates a window, draws oval objects in the window, and animates the circles. Circles are set to random colors
and change direction on mouse action touching/hovering on them. Circles bounce of the window walls. When circles/blobs collide 
they combine to make a bigger blob and the color changes to a new random color.
