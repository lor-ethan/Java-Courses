# Block-Bust
CS 120

This program creates a window, draws rectangle/block objects in the window, and aminates the blocks. Blocks continue to fall on top
of existing the blocks. Blocks are random colors. When a block is clicked all the blocks of the same color that are touching will be
popped from the window. When blocks reach the top of the window the user loses and the game is over. After scoring enough points the 
user wins.
