# Latin-Squares
CS 220

This program creates a latin squares game. Latin squares is a puzzle that is played on a 6 by 6 grid of cells. Some of the cells are given
initial values in the range 1 through 6. The puzzle is solved by entering a digit in the range 1
through 6 in each empty cell in such a way that no row contains any duplicate numbers and no
column contains any duplicate numbers.
