# Sort Comparison
CS 220

This program compares three sorting algorithms bubble, merge, and quicksort. Each algorithm is individually implemented. 
The test program runs each algorithm on an increasing number of randomly generated arrays and compares how each 
algorithm does at sorting the random data of increasing size.
