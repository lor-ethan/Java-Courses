# Word-Cloud
CS 220

A word cloud is an image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each
word indicates its frequency or importance.

This program creates a word cloud. It takes a file input and compares it a file with common/important words and generates a 
word cloud based on the frequencies of words and their importance.
